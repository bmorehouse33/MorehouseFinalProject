For my final project, I have decided to create an application that allows users to check out study rooms based on how long a user will need a study room, how many study rooms are open, and how many students will be in the study room.  Users will open the browser and enter the above information and the system will search for open rooms are available for the time selected and can seat the correct amount of people.  If the criteria meet the users request then the user will be able to reserve the study room. If the user inputs criteria that is not available, the system will have them try for a different time to check out a study room.  I plan to use an SQL database to store the users information as well as the study rooms that are available to check out.  The use cases for my project are allowing users to enter the date, duration, location, and number of students for the study room, allowing users to then reserve the study room, and allowing users to cancel, move, or change their study room request.  For the project schedule, I plan(not necessarily in this order) to have: (1)the user interface, (2,3,4) each use case, (5)connecting to the server, and (6)final clean up/bug fixes done each week (one done per week).  I believe this project is interesting because there is a huge need for a simple way for this to be done. On campus now, I have using the online method of reserving a study room so I end up just calling the library and doing it myself because it is much easier.  If I can create a system that does this very easily and hassle-free, then I think there could be a very important use for it.  This project is a good test of my abilities because it incorporates many different aspects (servers, databases, timers, etc.) and will push me to learn new things that we have not already gone over in class this year or in past years.
